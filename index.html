    <h3> Summary </h3>

  <p>  
    A passionate senior academic, going for PhD at Bournemouth University. Requires funding of 30,000 pounds.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p> My area of interest is Retail Loss Prevention Strategies (RLPS) among supermarkets in the UK and Nigeria. Retail Loss (RL) is the bane of all retailers worldwide. The research will shed more light on nature and extent of inventory shrinkage among supermarkets and the findings could assist retailers with new strategies to mitigate the problem. I have secured admission to pursue the PhD program at Bournemouth University. Please I require funding from you to undertake the research.</p>
